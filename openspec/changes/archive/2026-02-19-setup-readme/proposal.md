## Why

The project README is currently just a title and tagline ("Generate OpenSpec badge"). Contributors and users arriving at the repo have no idea what this action does, how to use it, or what the project roadmap looks like. Issue #1 explicitly calls for "minimal about and instructions in the README.md."

## What Changes

- Expand `README.md` with project description, planned features, usage instructions, and contributing guidance
- Content draws from Issue #1 (project setup goals) and Issue #2 (badge generation vision)

## Capabilities

### New Capabilities
- `project-readme`: Comprehensive README covering what the action does, how to use it, and how to contribute

### Modified Capabilities
<!-- None -->

## Impact

- `README.md`: Expanded from 2 lines to full project documentation
